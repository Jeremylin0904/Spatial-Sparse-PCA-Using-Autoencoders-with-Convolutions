# NYCU Master Thesis - Spatial Sparse PCA using Autoencoders with Convolutions

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my master's thesis at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU). This repository contains the code and data for my thesis titled "Spatial Sparse Principal Component Analysis Using Autoencoders with Convolutions."

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `1Dlinear.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for 1D linear simulation.
- `2Dlinear.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for 2D linear simulation.
- `2Dnonlinear.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for 2D nonlinear simulation.
- `DataAnalysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for real data analysis on the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) dataset. The data is located in the `SST` folder (data.rar).
- `Modelperformance.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the evaluation of model performance. The data for this analysis is available in the `1D`, `2D`, and `2Dnonlinear` folders.
- `thesis_saec.pdf`: The draft of my thesis.

## Data

- `SST`: Folder containing the Sea Surface Temperature dataset (data.rar).
- `1D`: Folder containing data for the 1D linear simulation.
- `2D`: Folder containing data for the 2D linear simulation.
- `2Dnonlinear`: Folder containing data for the 2D nonlinear simulation.
